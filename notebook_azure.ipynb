The hidden states and outputs at each time step are the concatenation of those produced by the forward and backward RNNs.\n",

This techique can also be applied independently at each time step to produce an output for each element of the sequence.\n",

    "- Dynamic learning rate or [batch size](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00489).\n",

    "- Make the word embeddings trainable.\n",
    "- Use higher dimensional word embeddings.\n",
    "- Add dropout layers to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- Apply **batch normalization**.\n",
    "- Add an **attention** mechanism over the RNN outputs / hidden states for each time step.\n",
    "- Add **convolution** over the input sequence where the filters are inputs to an RNN.\n",
    "- Add **character level embeddings**\n",
    "- Incorporate features learned by other embedding models (e.g. universal sentence encoder, NNLM, character level embeddings, ELMo) and **fine tune** them. Check out TensorFlow Hub."
